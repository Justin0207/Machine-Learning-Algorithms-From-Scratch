# üß† Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch & TensorFlow

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **machine learning algorithms**, implemented from scratch using **pure Python/NumPy**, and also replicated using **TensorFlow** for comparison. It‚Äôs an ideal resource for students, developers, researchers, and curious minds who want to go beyond black-box models and truly **understand the math and mechanics** behind machine learning. The goal is to demystify how popular ML models work internally and bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

## üìö Motivation

Most machine learning libraries provide easy-to-use APIs that abstract away the complexity behind the scenes. But if you're truly looking to:

- Master the fundamentals of ML algorithms
- Learn the math and logic from first principles
- Ace job interviews with confidence
- Build your own customized models

...then building ML algorithms from scratch is a **game-changer**.
